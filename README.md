# ZenTangle Attack-a-thon
ZenTangle team is keen to see the ecosystem running in production. Now, after months of development and testing, we are closer to the transition to IOTA Mainnet and Assembly Networks. However, before opening the gates for real funds, we have to test the security of the ZenTangle key components.

## Monday, 2022-02-18, 18:00 UTC to Friday, 2022-02-28, 18:00 UTC

In the lead-up to the transition to mainnet, we are inviting the IOTA community members to the ZenTangle Attack-a-Thon! With this event we would like to challenge you to try and break different parts of the Data Clustering Smart Contract and the NFT Auction Sale Service. You will be rewarded for your findings.

The ZenTangle Attack-a-Thon is a security researcher/developer/rustacean/reactacean oriented challenge. Everyone is invited to join and try to grab a few great prizes. Itâ€™s intended as a fun community experience, which you will see reflected in the rewards. The top 3 attackers that identify vulnerabilities or oportunities of improvement around the Data Clustering Smart Contract, or the NFT Auction Sale Service will get: 

1. First Place 0.5% of the Genesis Sale + 3 Genesis NFT Cards
1. First Place 0.3% of the Genesis Sale + 2 Genesis NFT Cards
1. First Place 0.2% of the Genesis Sale + 1 Genesis NFT Card

*Funds will be paid in IOTA Mainnet Tokens.

The ZenTangle Attack-a-Thon runs for around 10 days: it starts on the 18th of February 2022 at 1800 UTC and ends on the 28th of February 2022 at 1800 UTC.

The selection of the winning hackers will be held through a voting pool at ZenTangle DAO, Soonaverse Space.

The Scope of the Attack-a-Thon are the following ZenTangle components:
1. [Data Clustering Smart Contract](https://github.com/zignartech/zentangle-wasp)
1. [NFT Auction Sale Service (Mainnet IOTA Tokens)]()

The rules of engagement are pretty simple:
Hacker to submit a valid entry to the this repository during the defined time period to be eligible for prize.
Every issue in the scope counts singularly (e.g. If an injection makes it possible to escalate privileges it counts as two issues).
The evaluation committee might count the submission if it is a particular vulnerability outside of the proposed scope.
Share your discord user through the ZenTangle Community Channel, and coordinate with Zignar Team to present your findings for the final community voting under the ZenTangle DAO.
